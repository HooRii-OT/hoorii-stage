# HooRii Stage - Bespoke HomeAI, Built for Belonging

## 💡 What Is HooRii Stage?

**HooRii Stage** is an **open and modular hardware platform** designed to bring **HooRii AI** into the physical world.

It acts as a tangible **shell** for a single, persistent AI identity — providing the **display, voice, sensors, and physical presence** that allow an AI character to exist naturally in your home. 

Stage does not define the AI’s personality or memory — it **gives the AI a body**. 

This isn't just a **smarter home**.
It's a **home with a soul** — one you created.

## ✨ Core Features

### 💫 Emotionally Adaptive System

When hosted on Stage, **HooRii AI** gains a continuous physical presence. Through voice, visual feedback, and environmental awareness, interactions feel more natural and emotionally grounded — closer to engaging with a living presence than issuing commands to a device.

Powered by **HooRii AI**, the system integrates advanced multimodal technology with a **Self-Evolving Memory Engine**. This enables long-term, spatiotemporal memory, allowing the AI to remember your habits, preferences, and daily routines over time. Every interaction becomes a **growth moment**, refining how the AI understands you and responds.

As it learns, the AI gradually behaves like a thoughtful **“super butler”** — anticipating needs, adapting to patterns, and personalizing your home experience across devices. **HooRii Stage** enables these emotional and intelligent capabilities to manifest in the real world.

### 🏠 Redefining HomeAI: Beyond a Voice Assistant

Powered by smart IoT technology, you can control multiple smart home devices in one click through natural voice interaction — no manual operation required. It enables seamless interconnection across brands and protocols, making daily home life more efficient and hassle-free.

The AI character you create goes beyond a simple "voice assistant". Say something like “I’m so tired from work today”, and the AI can interpret intent and respond accordingly, such as adjusting lights or the indoor atmosphere to help you unwind.

### 🔄 One AI, Multiple Shells

AI characters can seamlessly transition **move between devices** — mobile apps, desktop environments, and HooRii Stage — while maintaining a **unified memory and identity**.

The AI exists on **only one device at a time**, “entering” and “exiting” different shells as needed. HooRii Stage is optimized to be the **always-on physical home** in this multi-device experience.

### 🌟 Workshop: One-Stop Creation of AI Agents

AI characters hosted on Stage are created and managed through **HooRii Workshop**, a platform that integrates key components such as **ASR**, **LLM**, **TTS**, and **AI-based image and video generation**, enabling **rapid role creation and deployment** without the need for complex configurations.

When creating an AI character, you can fully customize it or choose from preset "independent personality" roles that simulate human-like behavior.

- **Custom Mode** — Design every trait from scratch.
- **Platform Preset Mode** — Start with curated personalities.
- **Community Mode** — Explore and adopt creations shared by others.
